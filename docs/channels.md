# channels.md — Per-Channel Features & Official Limits

**Last updated:** 2026-08-11
**Status:** draft

> Every channel module implements a uniform `send(lead, rendered)` interface and goes
> through `lib/ratelimit`. Consolidated numbers live in [rate-limits.md](rate-limits.md).

---

## Email

**Stack:** Nodemailer (SMTP, no heavy deps) or Gmail API. Optional SendGrid/Mailgun
for high volume.

**Features**
- TLS/STARTTLS, **OAuth2** for Gmail/Exchange, **DKIM signing**, attachments,
  HTML + text bodies.
- Template variables (`{{firstName}}`, `{{companyName}}`, …) with fallbacks.
- Bounce/spam tracking via webhooks or IMAP; suppression on hard bounce.

**Deliverability requirements**
- Authenticate the sending domain: **SPF + DKIM** (Nodemailer supports DKIM),
  ideally DMARC.
- Warm up new domains/accounts; monitor bounce + spam rates (Google throttles on
  poor reputation).

**Limits (Gmail/Workspace)**
- Free/trial: **500 messages/day**. Paid Workspace: **~2,000/day**.
- External recipients capped (e.g. ~3,000/day outside your domain); ≤500 recipients
  per message; rolling 24h window.
- Practical throttle: queue + pause (~40 emails/hour) to avoid blocks. Full strategy
  in [rate-limits.md](rate-limits.md).

### Who a message goes out as (2026-08-11)

**Every message a contact receives leaves through a `SendingAccount` the workspace
connected itself.** There is no platform fallback mailbox, and re-adding one would
reintroduce four problems at once:

- mail left under Followthroo's `MAIL_FROM` rather than the customer's domain, while
  the body was still signed with the rep's name;
- the reply poller only walks `SendingAccount` rows, so replies to that mailbox were
  **never captured** — stop-on-reply never fired, the Inbox stayed empty, and no
  follow-up task was ever created;
- deliverability reputation was shared across every tenant, and the Deliverability
  page (keyed on `sendingAccountId`) could not score it;
- the rate limiter keys on `(org, account)`, so each tenant got a *separate* quota
  against one physical mailbox — N orgs × 40/hour through a single account.

A send with no connected account now fails loudly with a reason the UI shows.

`SMTP_*` / `MAIL_FROM` still exist, for exactly one purpose: `sendSystemEmail()` in
`lib/channels/email.ts`, which is Followthroo mailing **its own users** (new-lead
alerts, SLA escalations). It is a separate function from `emailChannel.send` so the
line can't blur, and nothing it sends is ever addressed to a lead.

**Tenant scoping:** an account id is a bare uuid, so every lookup is
`findFirst({ id, organizationId })` and `orgId` is part of the adapter's `send()`
signature. `/api/campaigns` (POST + PATCH) and `/api/agent` verify the submitted
account belongs to the caller before attaching it. Guarded by
`scripts/verify-sending.ts`.

## LinkedIn

**Reality:** LinkedIn is stringent. Automation of a personal account is a gray area
that violates LinkedIn's terms and risks restriction. Use with extreme care.

**Options**
- **Official API** — only **company/organization pages** are cleanly supported
  (`w_organization_social_feed` for admins). Personal-account actions need
  `w_member_social_feed`, granted **only to approved partners**.
- **Browser automation** (Puppeteer/Playwright) to click Connect / send messages as a
  logged-in user. Fragile, TOS-sensitive; preserve session cookies securely, use a
  stable IP.

**Limits & humanization**
- Start at **~20 invites/day** for a new account; ramp gradually with acceptance rate
  (e.g. +5/week). Hidden caps trigger "Try again next week."
- Randomize delays, interleave organic actions (profile visits, likes), stop on
  "out of invites." Never burst. Consider multiple accounts with distinct IPs only if
  compliant with your risk posture.

## WhatsApp

**Stack:** Official **WhatsApp Business API** via **Twilio** (Node/Python SDK) or
Meta's API directly.

**Rules**
- Messages outside the **24-hour** customer service window must use **pre-approved
  templates**, and require prior **opt-in**.
- Respect the **quality rating** — throttle or fall back if quality drops to negative.

**Limits (messaging tiers, per business portfolio)**
- New account: **250 unique users / 24h**, shared across all numbers in the portfolio.
- Auto-scales **250 → 2,000 → 10,000 → 100,000** after business verification / sending
  high-quality messages. Twilio default: 250 contacts/day, upgradable via Meta's
  scaling program.
- Track unique recipients in a rolling 24h; queue overflow to the next day.

## Social comments

Posting comments/replies on social posts. Prefer official APIs; fall back to careful
browser automation with randomized timing only where TOS allows.

| Platform | API surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | Comments API — **organization posts** only; personal limited (`w_member_social_feed`) | OAuth app; same partner restriction |
| Twitter/X | API v2 tweets/replies | Recent pricing changes; check current tier |
| Facebook | Graph API page comments (user token) | Per-app rate limits |
| Instagram | Business API commenting on **business** posts | OAuth; business account required |

**Rule:** heed each platform's TOS + rate limits; add natural delays; never mass-spam.

---

## Uniform module contract

```ts
// lib/channels/<name>/index.ts
export interface Channel {
  send(lead: Lead, rendered: RenderedMessage): Promise<SendResult>;
  // must acquire quota from lib/ratelimit before sending
  // must write messages + activity_log on completion
}
```

---

## Deliverability & tracking (Phase 2 — 2026-07-05)

- **Open/click tracking** (`lib/tracking.ts`): before each email send, `job-processor`
  pre-generates the `Message` id, rewrites `http(s)` links to `/api/track/click/[messageId]`
  and appends a 1×1 pixel at `/api/track/open/[messageId]`. Both routes are unauthenticated,
  resolve the org from the `Message`, write an `ActivityLog(opened|clicked)` (with `messageId`),
  and — for clicks — 302 to the original URL. Feeds Reports and the campaign `condition`
  nodes (`opened` / `clicked`).
- **Reports** (`/dashboard/reports`, `lib/reports.ts`): funnel, engagement time series,
  per-campaign breakdown, open/click/reply rates (Recharts).
- **Mailbox warm-up** (`lib/warmup.ts`): enabled mailboxes in an org email each other on a
  ramping daily schedule (`/api/warmup/run`, cron every 4h). The reply poller
  (`lib/inbox/poller.ts`) recognizes warm-up mail (sender is one of the org's own mailboxes),
  records `WarmupEvent` placement (inbox/spam) and **rescues spam** via Gmail `messages.modify`.
- **Deliverability** (`/dashboard/deliverability`, `lib/deliverability.ts`): per-mailbox
  score = inbox/received; toggle warm-up + daily target per mailbox.
- **Per-account DKIM**: `SendingAccount.dkim{Domain,Selector,PrivateKey}` now sign per-account
  SMTP sends (previously only the env default transport was signed).
- **Gmail scope**: connecting a Gmail account now requests `gmail.modify` (read + label
  changes) in addition to `gmail.send`. Accounts connected before this must reconnect for
  reply polling + warm-up placement/rescue to work.

## LinkedIn — companion Chrome extension, human-assisted (Phase 5 — updated)

LinkedIn does **not** grant connection-invite or DM access through its developer program,
and its User Agreement (§8.2) prohibits bots or automated methods for connections/messages
outright. So this is deliberately **not** autonomous: a companion Chrome extension drafts
each action from the user's own logged-in LinkedIn session, in their browser, but a human
reviews and clicks Send themselves — the extension never does.

**Flow:**
1. A campaign `send` node with `channel: "linkedin"` → `lib/channels/linkedin.ts` enqueues a
   `LinkedInAction` (it no longer no-ops).
2. The extension (`extension/`, MV3) polls `GET /api/linkedin/queue` (auth: per-member
   `LinkedInAccount.extToken`), claims one action, opens the profile in a **foregrounded**
   tab, and fills the invite note / message box via injected DOM automation — then stops.
   It reports `status: "drafted"` back so the queue/cap accounting sees it as in-flight.
3. The human reviews what's filled, sends it themselves in that tab, then confirms **"I
   sent it"** (or **Skip**) in the extension popup — only that confirmation
   `POST /api/linkedin/queue`s the terminal outcome, recorded as a `Message` +
   `ActivityLog` + `ConversationEvent` (visible in reports/timeline). Polling stays paused
   on one drafted action at a time until the human resolves it, then waits a randomized
   `min–maxDelaySec` before drafting the next.

**Caps + safety:** daily invite cap enforced server-side in `lib/linkedin/queue.ts`
(`claimActions`, now counting `drafted` toward the cap too); the extension drafts one
action per tick (default 45–120s apart); stale in-progress claims are auto-reclaimed after
15 min, stale drafted ones (human never came back) after 40 min. Config + token live at
`/dashboard/settings/linkedin`.

**⚠️ ToS:** drafting from a personal LinkedIn account is still automation-adjacent even
with a human sending — keep caps conservative (≤ ~20 invites/day), warm up new accounts,
don't leave large batches queued unattended. The official "Sign in with LinkedIn (OIDC)" +
"Share on LinkedIn" APIs cover identity and posting — see the next section, which is now built.

## LinkedIn — connecting an account, officially (2026-09-04)

**Why this section exists.** Every competitor advertises "connect your LinkedIn account" and
we did not have one, which read as a missing feature. It was two things at once: a real gap
(there was no account connection anywhere in the product, only a bearer token to paste into
an extension) and a question about architecture. Both are answered here.

### What competitors mean by it

Expandi, Dripify, HeyReach, Waalaxy (cloud mode) and PhantomBuster ask for the member's
`li_at` session cookie — sometimes directly, sometimes through a "connector" extension whose
only job is to read the cookie and ship it to the vendor. The vendor stores that session and
drives LinkedIn as the member from its own cloud, usually behind a dedicated residential
proxy per account so the traffic looks like it comes from one person.

That is what makes unattended, laptop-off automation possible, and it is also its own
failure mode: a live session used from an IP the member has never signed in from is the
clearest signal LinkedIn's enforcement has. Restrictions in this category are routine, and
a breach of any one vendor exposes every customer's LinkedIn account simultaneously.

### What we built instead

`lib/linkedin/oauth.ts` — LinkedIn's own 3-legged OAuth. The member clicks **Connect
LinkedIn account** in Settings → LinkedIn, consents on linkedin.com, and returns with their
verified name, photo and email on their `LinkedInAccount` row.

| | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Authorize | `https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization` |
| Token | `https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken` |
| Identity | `https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo` |
| Post | `https://api.linkedin.com/rest/posts` (`LinkedIn-Version` header required) |

**Scopes:** `openid profile email` (Sign In with LinkedIn) + `w_member_social` (Share on
LinkedIn). Overridable via `LINKEDIN_SCOPES`, because scope availability is per-app — asking
for a scope the app has not been granted fails the whole consent with "Invalid scope"
rather than degrading gracefully.

**Redirect URI** must be registered verbatim in the Developer Portal:
`https://app.followthroo.com/api/linkedin/oauth/callback`. LinkedIn strips query parameters
from it, so the member and org travel in httpOnly cookies (`li_oauth_state` / `_org` /
`_user`), state-checked in the callback.

**Token lifetime is 60 days with no refresh.** Programmatic refresh tokens are gated behind
LinkedIn's partner programme, so an ordinary app cannot renew silently. `connectionState()`
returns `expiring` from 7 days out and the settings page prompts a reconnect, rather than
letting the member discover it through a post that did not go out.

**Storage:** `liAccessToken` / `liRefreshToken` are in `ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS`
(`lib/db-encryption.ts`), so they are AES-256-GCM ciphertext at rest like every other tenant
credential. Neither ever reaches a browser — `GET /api/linkedin/connect` returns a name, a
photo URL and an expiry date. Disconnecting nulls the columns outright rather than setting a
flag.

### What the connection does and does not unlock

| Capability | Official API | How we do it |
|---|---|---|
| Verified identity | ✅ `openid profile email` | OAuth, this section |
| Post to own feed | ✅ `w_member_social` | `lib/linkedin/post.ts`, server-side, no browser |
| Read search results | ❌ not sold at any tier | Extension, member's own tab |
| Company employees, post likers, group members, event guests | ❌ | Extension |
| Send connection invitations | ❌ | Extension drafts, human sends |
| Send messages | ❌ | Extension drafts, human sends |

Sales Navigator and Marketing Developer Platform APIs are partner-gated and closed to
general applicants; they do not change this table for a self-serve SaaS.

**So both halves are load-bearing.** The account connection is the member's identity and
their posting rights, and it is genuinely official. The extension is how sourcing and
drafting happen, in the member's own session where the activity is indistinguishable from
what it is — a person using LinkedIn. Neither replaces the other, and the settings page says
so in a disclosure on the page rather than leaving people to wonder.

**Verification:** `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/verify-linkedin-oauth.ts` — 21
checks covering the encryption registration and AAD binding, authorize-URL construction, and
the expiry state machine. No database required.
