# templates-and-variables.md — Template Engine, Variables, Sequencing

**Last updated:** 2026-07-03

> Personalization is the point: personalized messages get replies; generic ones get

## Engine
- **Handlebars** (or Mustache) for `{{variable}}` substitution — unlimited custom
  variables from imported CSV columns.
- Rendered per-lead at send time by `lib/templates` using `leads` data
  ([crm-data-model.md](crm-data-model.md)).

## Variables
**Defaults:** `{{firstName}}`, `{{lastName}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{email}}`.
**Custom:** any CSV column → variable (e.g. `industry`, `painPoint` →
`{{industry}}`, `{{painPoint}}`). Stored in `leads.custom` jsonb.

**Fallbacks (required):** use `{{firstName|there}}` syntax so missing data still reads
smoothly — never ship "Hi ," or "Hello {{firstName}}". Every template must define
fallbacks for any non-guaranteed field.

## Authoring & safety
- **Preview** with sample data before send; render each variable substituted.
- **Test send** to yourself to catch broken merges.
- **Spam-score check** on content before a batch goes out ([rate-limits.md](rate-limits.md)).
- Conversational tone; subject line + body both support variables. LinkedIn/WhatsApp
  use the same variable system (WhatsApp templates need Meta pre-approval).

### Example (email)
```
Subject: Quick idea for {{company|your team}}

Hi {{firstName|there}}, I noticed {{company}} is innovating in
{{industry|your field}}. It reminds me of work we did at XYZ Corp — could we
connect and share ideas?
```

## Sequences
A campaign is an ordered list of steps with **wait conditions**:
```jsonc
[
  { "channel": "email",    "template": "intro",     "wait": "0d" },
  { "channel": "email",    "template": "followup1", "wait": "2d", "unless": "replied" },
  { "channel": "linkedin", "template": "connect",   "wait": "3d", "unless": "replied" },
  { "channel": "whatsapp", "template": "nudge",     "wait": "2d", "onlyIf": "phone_opt_in" }
]
```
- Executed via **BullMQ** delayed jobs, each gated by `lib/ratelimit`.
- **Triggers/branches:** skip/advance on opens, clicks, replies, invite-accepted.
- A reply or unsubscribe halts the lead's remaining steps and adds them to suppression.

## Storage
Templates: `id`, `channel`, `name`, `subject`, `body`, `variables[]` (declared +
required fallbacks), `updated_at`. Sequences live on `campaigns.sequence` jsonb
([crm-data-model.md](crm-data-model.md)).
